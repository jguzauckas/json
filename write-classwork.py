# Create a blank list called "grades".


# Using the random module, generate 100,000 random grades as
# integers from 0 to 100 and add each one to the list.


# Write the list of grades to a json file called "grades.json".


# Create a blank dictionary called "people".


# Read in the "names.json" file and save it to a variable.


# Go through the names data. For each name, add it to the dictionary
# as a key, and make its value a randomly-generated True or False.
# Hint: Use a random number and then use if to choose True or False.


# Write your dictionary to the "people.json" file.
